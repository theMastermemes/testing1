## Physical Description

Shadowkin appear as lithe humanoids with dusky grey skin that seems to shift and fade at the edges. Their eyes are deep violet or silver, and they cast unusually dim shadows. They move with fluid, almost dancing grace.

## Culture and Society

Shadowkin organize into **Twilight Houses** - secretive family networks that control different aspects of their hidden society. They value cunning, adaptability, and the preservation of secrets above all else.

### The Five Houses
- House Whisper (information gathering and espionage)
- House Veil (illusion magic and misdirection)
- House Blade (martial arts and assassination)
- House Moon (shadow magic and rituals)
- House Key (thievery and infiltration)

## Shadow Abilities

All Shadowkin possess innate shadow magic, allowing them to:
- Blend with shadows for near-invisibility
- Step through shadows for short-distance teleportation
- Sense emotions and lies through shadow-reading

## Relations with Other Races

- **[Valdari](/docs/races/valdari)**: Grudging mutual respect; both value ancient knowledge
- **[Ironborn](/docs/races/ironborn)**: Professional courtesy between artisans, though few trust them
- **Surface folk**: Generally viewed with suspicion; Shadowkin prefer to remain unseen

## The Shadow Compact

An ancient agreement with the [Deity of Twilight](/docs/deities) grants them their powers in exchange for maintaining the balance between light and dark.

## Shadowkin Settlements

Few know the locations of their hidden cities. The most famous is **Umbralyn**, said to exist in a pocket of permanent twilight.
