# Ward Magic

Ward magic represents one of the oldest and most fundamental forms of protective magic, creating barriers between the caster and various forms of harm.

## Basic Principles

Ward magic operates on the principle of **sympathetic protection** - by establishing a connection between the caster's will and the forces they wish to exclude, barriers can be erected that selectively allow or deny passage.

## Ward Types

### Physical Wards
| Ward | Level | Duration | Effect |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Shield of Faith** | 1st | 1 hour | +2 AC against physical attacks |
| **Barrier of Force** | 3rd | 10 minutes | Wall of magical force |
| **Sanctuary Circle** | 5th | 8 hours | Area protection from intrusion |

### Magical Wards
- **Dispel Ward**: Blocks specific spell schools
- **Null Field**: Creates areas of anti-magic
- **Spell Turning**: Reflects targeted spells back to caster

### Spiritual Wards
- **Sacred Ground**: Prevents undead and fiends from entering
- **Circle of Binding**: Traps extraplanar creatures
- **Consecration**: Blesses an area with divine protection

## Ward Components

### Material Components
- **Silver dust**: Enhances ward conductivity
- **Salt circles**: Traditional barrier material  
- **Blessed oils**: Divine ward enhancement
- **Runic stones**: Permanent ward anchors

### Ritual Requirements
Most powerful wards require:
- Careful preparation of the protected area
- Specific timing (often dawn, dusk, or midnight)
- Multiple casters for large-scale protections
- Ongoing maintenance and renewal

## Limitations and Counters

Wards can be overcome through:
- **Dispelling**: Direct magical assault on the ward structure
- **Overwhelming**: Exceeding the ward's capacity
- **Circumvention**: Finding loopholes in the ward's parameters
- **Decay**: Allowing the ward to weaken over time
